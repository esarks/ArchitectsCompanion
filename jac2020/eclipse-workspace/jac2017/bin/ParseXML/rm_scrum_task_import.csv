Tyrrell,
Do you approve deleting Build 5 for project Prosthetics Purchasing and CPRS Enhancements?
Namrata and Krishna upon PJâ€™s or Tyrrellâ€™s approval could you help the user with deleting Build 5 for Prosthetics Purchasing and CPRS Enhancements?
Build 5 was mistakenly added by the project team and should be removed because it involves the closeout phase.

Could you help PPO by switching the flag â€œIs Project Activeâ€?  from Yes to No for Systematic Technical Accuracy Review (STAR) 2 project?  This should not be reported to OMB for the August submission as this project is scheduled to be deactivated.

User from PPO needs the flag â€œIs Project Activeâ€?  from Yes to No for Systematic Technical Accuracy Review (STAR) 2 project.  We already have a ticket #1842 for the same issue.  This may need to be moved up in the que because this project needs to be deactivated before OMB submission.

Lac has run the script to update omb submission dates for all omb submissions done in July. So now user should be able to see Rebaseline option. Please let me know if user still has issue.
