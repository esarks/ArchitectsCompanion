-User is stating that they have to change the flag for â€œDoes your project require a Contractâ€? back to Yes because the dashboard keeps changing it back to No when she makes other updates.

This is happening for the following record: ""Project is Benefits Delivery Network (BDN) Retirement Phase 1""

Service request #2133 from Malina Crear

""I have updated the answer several times on the VIP Dashboard to ""yes"" in response to the question ""Does your Project Require a Contract?"" I had to do it 3 times a couple of weeks ago and I made sure I hit ""save"" each time.  It keeps defaulting back to ""no"". This has been going on for the last 2 months and I just noticed it again today when I had to update something else. Once again, I had to change the answer back to ""yes"". Can someone please look into this matter given this project does require a contract; however, there is a glitch within the VIP Dashboard keeps changing it back to ""No"". ""
