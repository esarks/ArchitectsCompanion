Can perform a make by editing C:\GitHub\ArchitectsCompanion\jac2020\bin\SetJob.bat

There is a reference to JAC_SCRIPTS

Un-rem the third line to set appropriately.  It's not as automated as I'd like...but this works.
Remember to rem the third line when finished.

set JAC_SCRIPTS=%JAC_BASE%\app
rem - use below for jackbuild8 com.esarks.jac.Make
rem set JAC_SCRIPTS="C:\GitHub\ArchitectsCompanion\jac2020\jacBuild8\source\scripts"
