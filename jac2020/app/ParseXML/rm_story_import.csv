We need to have the PM change the project IsActive field to No. It still has to be OMBR yes in order to send that deactivation to OMB to remove the record at OMB (no longer active). This would be for projects that we no longer intend to proceed with as planned for whatever reason.
 
When the parent activity (project) is deactivated, the child activity (project phase) is automatically removed as well. No parent, no child.

Original request:
Request VIP Dashboard implementation of a data check to not allow projected cost updates an finish/completion dateâ€‹ actual date has been entered for the applicable build/phase. If they have completed the build/phase, then they aren't gathering projected costs â€“ they are gathering actual costs.
	-Any known variations from planned cost or schedule should be updated in the ""projected"" field when first realized, to provide a more accurate estimate as the project progresses. Best practice is to evaluate estimates at intervals throughout the lifecycle, and at a minimum at least 80% into the activity or when known changes to resource allocations arise.
Updating projected costs at that time, is basically fudging the data so that the projected costs do not fall outside 10% of the actual cost and not an indicator of proper project management.",3 - Medium,In Progress,3 pts,"Acceptance Criteria from (06/27):
-Add a business rule validation to not allow projected cost updates when finish/completion dateâ€‹ actual date has been entered for the applicable build/phase
-Show the following validation rule ""Projected Costs cannot be updated once an Actual Date has been provided"" when user tries to update projected costs
-Do not allow the user to save any projected cost changes because after providing the Actual Dates, Actual Costs should be known

Team recommendation: Implement banner feature along with this user story


Freeze/lock database during the process of XML-generation
 
(current time:  ~5 seconds per XML â€“ the time from when user clicks â€˜generate/re-generate XMLâ€™ to when the XML file is successfully generated)

 
- Insignificant downtime to users
- Same implementation for file re-generation
- Minimum code updates
- Minimum manual intervention by tool admin

 
- Will need concurrence from PPO and the PM community


Testing Considerations:
1. Read-only across all modules
2. Unfrozen across all modules
3. Confirming the time length works across all modules

-Text of the outage
-Time allotment?

Banner (to inform users about the scheduled outage):
-User needs to be informed databases in frozen
-User needs to be able to create a banner alert to apply to the entire VIP Dashboard
-When to generate the banner?
  -Onus is on VIP Team to inform users about the freeze
  -Should be promoted AT LEAST 3 days in advance
  -Outage should be for ~one hour
-User has option to close the banner; otherwise displays for across the entire Dashboard

Confirm: if user should use their own language for the banner

Banners can currently be stored FYI

Further considerations:
-Determine if set time (1 hour) or scheduled time (determined/modifiable) is preferable!!
-Need to consider the potential for overlapping banner messages",2 - High,Implemented,8 pts,"Acceptance Criteria:

12/28: CIO Rating calculation won't have to change very often (e.g. every 3 months)


UAT Results from Nov 2017:
1.  Requirement update:  Contractor Oversight - If project is in the Init Phase, default should be 3.
2.  Requirement update:  Historical Performance - If project is in the Init Phase, default should also be 3.
3.  Defect:  Requirement Management â€“ If project is in Project Phase, and both PMP and Business Epics dates are missing, rating should be 1.
4.  Requirement update:  Schedule Variance in days for an Activity = Planned Completion Date â€“ Actual Completion Date .  If Actual Completion Date is not available, use Projected Completion Date.  Also, use todayâ€™s date if the Projected Completion Date has passed without reporting an Actual Completion Date.


Potential Testing Methodology (from 12/28):
1. Select a particular investment
2. Ensure all projects in an investment are not OMB reportable
3. Find designated project

The team had a brainstorming session on Tues (10/24/17). Here are the notes from that meeting:

To summarize our approach, here are the key points I noted:
 
1.     In the VIP Database, create a stored procedure that will return all user accounts who have not logged into the VIP Dashboard for more than 90 days. Have the store procedure execute against the existing table called â€œdbo.VIPAnalyticsâ€?.
2.     Store the results of the query in a new table called â€œdbo.VIPInactiveUsersâ€?. Can this table serve the purpose of tracking who we email?
3.     In the VIP SharePoint site, create a SharePoint custom list and call it â€œInactive Usersâ€?.
4.     In SharePoint Designer, create a data connection between the â€œInactive Usersâ€? list and the â€œdbo.VIPInactiveUsersâ€? table. Make sure the table is pushing the data to the list.
5.     Once the data connection is established and we can confirm the list is being updated with information from the table, create a SharePoint workflow to run every night and email users who have not logged in for more than 90 days. Base the workflow off of the â€œInactive Usersâ€? custom list.
 
The unknown part so far is how to automatically remove users from a SharePoint user group, once they go past the 10 day email notification period. As discussed before, Iâ€™ll work to tackle the email notification portion and then we can approach the problem of user removal. For those who are interested, here is the PowerShell script I found online that outlines the possible solution.

Reasons for an EPS code change include change in the organizational pillar,  investment, or congressional project.  When assigning a new EPS code, this data element is selected by choosing the old code from the drop-down list.

UAT Notes: Unable to change the EPS code when copying a record to next FY. EPS users are also unable to edit an EPS Code within the same FY. If an EPS Code changes we should be able to change the code within the existing record. Then the old code will be in the new record under Source EPS Codes.",2 - High,Done,2 pts,"Acceptance Criteria:

Within the same Fiscal Year (via button within a single record)
-When projects get moved from one portfolio to another within the same FY, we need to have a way to keep the Source Code history.
-We need the ability to copy the record and have the ability to change the code by manually selecting each EPS Code level from the Sub-Org level through the Program level. The system will then automatically generate the next available 3 digit project code.
-The new EPS Code will source back to the original FY EPS record.
-All data will remain in the copied record. If possible, the original FY EPS record should automatically change from Approved â€œ""Yes""â€? to Approved â€œ""No"" as well as zeroing out all funding in original record only.

Additional Acceptance Criteria:
-Within the same Fiscal Year, if a VIP project is associated to an EPS record, the VIP project should be re-associated with the newly created EPS record and the VIP project will need to reflect the newest code
-When copying an EPS record from last Fiscal Year to current Fiscal Year, always re-point the VIP Project (if it exists) to the new EPS record
-When copying an EPS record from current Fiscal Year to next Fiscal Year, hold off on re-pointing the project (if it exists) to the next Fiscal Year EPS record until after September 30th
-Add an administrative function in the EPS Admin Console to â€œcatch upâ€? the projects that are attached to last year after September 30
-Source EPS Records, if they exist, will be displayed as links to other EPS records when viewing/editing an EPS record
-They will also be usable for reporting (e.g. for EPS History report)
-Moving a VIP Lifecycle Project record from an existing EPS record to a new EPS record will require the new EPS record to be populated with all of the Source EPS Records in the existing EPS record

2.  On the bottom of the home page the text Department of Veterans Affairs and Latest Review reads as a heading with assistive technology programs. This is regular paragraph text that appears at the bottom of the page and should not be tagged as heading text. (New: 11/15/2018)
3.  On the Reports and Data page the heading VIP Reports visually appears as a heading, but is not tagged as a heading for assistive technology users. (New: 11/16/2018)
4.  On the Management Reviews page the text VIP Management Reviews visually appears as a heading, but is not tagged for assistive technology users. (New: 11/19/2018)

2. Invisible instruction text is present when the viewport size is changed
Example:
1.  On the home page when the viewport size is changed instructions are read above the main navigation with assistive technology programs. These instructions do not appear visually on the page and should not be read. (New: 11/15/2018)

3. The name, role, state or value of user interface elements in the product cannot be understood
Example:
1.  A carousel is displayed visually on the homepage. There are several slides that can be clicked with a mouse. This information is read as a list of 4 items with assistive technology programs. (New: 11/15/2018)

Cost Calculations

Cost Variance ($)  = Sum All Planned Activities Costs minus Sum of all Actual Activities Costs (If no actual cost is available use projected cost)
Cost Variance (%) = (Cost Variance ($) / Sum of Planned total cost) X 100
Cost Status = Cost Variance (%) is color coded to Federal IT Dashboard <10% is green; >=10% and <30% is yellow and >=30% is red

Schedule Calculations

For each activity measure it's variance in days under the following conditions:
â€¢New activities that are not started will have a variance if the current date reflects a date past the projected start date
â€¢In progress activities will have a variance if the current date reflects a date past the planned completion date
â€¢In progress activities will have a variance if the projected completion date is past the planned completion date
â€¢Completed activities will have a variance if the actual completion date is past the planned completion date

Schedule Variance Days = The project schedule variance is calculated in days based on the latest planned completion date of all activities minus the latest or actual projected completion date of all activities.
Project Duration = The project duration (needed to calculate variance percentage) is based on the latest planned completion date of all activities minus the earliest planned start date of all activities
Schedule Variance Percentage = (Schedule Variance Days/duration) x 100
Schedule Status is color coded to Federal IT Dashboard <10% is green; >=10% and <30% is yellow and >=30% is red


With that said for each of the metrics they have the following additional filters:
â€¢ Percent of OMB Projects On Schedule - Since Start of OMB Tracking & Percent of OMB Projects On Budget - Since Start of OMB Tracking
â€¢ Uses OMB Reportable projects in VIP + PMAS Projects that were OMB Reportable.  These are the metrics OMB displays on the Federal IT Dashboard.
â€¢ Percent of OMB Projects On Schedule  & Percent of OMB Projects On Budget
â€¢ Uses only OMB Reportable projects in VIP.
