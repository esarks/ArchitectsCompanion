	<h2><a name="overview">1. Architectural Overview</a></h2>
	<p>
		One goal of any interop tool is <i>transparency</i>. Ideally,
		a Java programmer could use a COM or Win32 component without even
		knowing she was doing so. The component would behave just like any
		ordinary Java class, and the presence of Win32/COM would be entirely
		transparent to the programmer.
	</p>
	<p>
		In reality, some details cannot be entirely hidden, so the next
		best thing is to have translucent access. A translucent stub is a Java
		class that hides <i>most</i> of the details of COM and Win32. The code
		below shows translucent stub code for accessing the Windows registry
		from Java. In this example. the methods have simple signatures that
		do not cause any particular challenges for a marshalling layer.
		As a result, the only departure from transparency is the presence
		of <code>COMException</code>s.
	</p>
	<p class="codeIndent">
		<code>public class Registry {<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;public static int OpenKey(int key, String subkey) throws COMException;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;public static int CreateKey(int key, String subkey) throws COMException;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void DeleteKey(int key, String subkey) throws COMException;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;public static String QueryStringValue(int key, String subkey) throws COMException;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;public static byte[] RawQueryValue(int key, String subkey) throws COMException;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;public static void CloseKey(int key) throws COMException;<br>
			}
		</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to produce stubs like the one shown above, you need three things:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>type information that describes the entry points or interfaces to be accessed.</li>
		<li>intrinsic functions (helper functions that marshal particular data types).</li>
		<li>a marshalling layer that assembles calls to the intrinsic functions based on the type information.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		Here is how Jawin does it:
		<a name="figure1"><img class="center" src="img/jawin.png" height="388px" width="761px"
		alt="Figure 1: Jawin overview" title="Figure 1: Jawin overview" /></a>
		The translucent stub is generated from type information,
		and is different for each COM interface or DLL entry point. Shared
		stubs handle common method signatures by calling native methods with
		correlated JNI signatures. The generic stub handles "everything else",
		i.e. methods that have less common signatures and therefore no
		shared stub. Both the generic stub and shared stubs use helper
		functions called intrinsic functions to marshal particular data types.
	</p>

	<h2><a name="intrinsics">2. Jawin Intrinsics</a></h2>
	<p>
		Jawin intrinsic functions are the atoms of marshalling. An intrinsic
		function knows how to convert one or more data types into a wire format,
		or how to retrieve data types from a wire format.
	</p>
	<p>
		On the Java side of Jawin, the intrinsics are located in the
		<code>org.jawin.io</code> package and the <code>org.jawin.Variant</code> class.
		<code>LittleEndianInputStream</code> and <code>LittleEndianOutputStream</code>
		know how to handle Java primitives, e.g.
	</p>
	<p class="codeIndent">
		<code>package org.jawin.io;<br>
			public class LittleEndianInputStream {<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;public final int readUnsignedShort() throws IOException {<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;InputStream in = this.in;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int ch2 = in.read();<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int ch1 = in.read();<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ((ch1 | ch2) &lt; 0)<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throw new EOFException();<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return (ch1 &lt;&lt; 8) + (ch2 &lt;&lt; 0);<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
			//etc.<br>
			}
		</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		As the class names suggest, Jawin marshalling always uses little endian
		byte order, which is the ordering expected by Win32 and COM. This
		strategy could be called "Java makes right" since all the byte-ordering
		work is done in Java, both during method calls and returns.
		I chose this approach because I believe that Java code is easier to
		write and test and equivalent COM code.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to handling data types, intrinsic functions also handle other
		semantic conversions. For example, there is a native intrinsic function
		that converts Win32/COM return values into Java exceptions:
	</p>
	<p class="codeIndent">
		<code>
			#define CHECK_NONE 0<br>
			#define CHECK_FALSE 1<br>
			#define CHECK_HRESULT 2<br>
			#define CHECK_W32 3<br>
			<br>
			inline bool checkRet(int ret, int flags) {<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;switch (flags) {<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;case CHECK_NONE:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return true;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;case CHECK_FALSE:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (!ret) {<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JNIComException::SetLastError();<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return false;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return true;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;case CHECK_HRESULT:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (FAILED(ret)) {<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JNIComException::SetContextException(ret);<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return false;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return true;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;case CHECK_W32:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if (ret != ERROR_SUCCESS) {<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JNIComException::SetContextException(ret);<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return false;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return true;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;default:<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JNIComException::SetContextException("Invalid code in checkRet");<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return false;<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
			}
		</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		On the native side of Jawin, the intrinsic functions are spread across
		SharedStubs.cpp, GenericStub.cpp, and Transform.cpp. At some future
		date they may be factored into an Intrinsics.cpp.
	</p>

	<h2><a name="sharedStubs">3. Shared Stubs</a></h2>
	<p>
		Jawin uses shared stubs to marshal COM and Win32 methods that have
		common signatures. For example, consider the following Win32
		function calls:
	</p>
	<p class="codeIndent">
		<code>HGDIOBJ GetStockObject(int fnObject);<br>
			HRESULT CoInitialize(LPVOID reserved);<br>
			BOOL UpdateWindow(HWND hwnd);<br>
			BOOL DeregisterEventSource(HANDLE hEventLog);&nbsp;
		</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		Semantically, the argument types and return values of these methods are all
		very different. However, all these types marshal the same, as 32-bit values.
		Thus it is possible to implement all of these methods with a single JNI entry
		point:
	</p>
	<p class="codeIndent">
		<code>public static native int invokeI_I(int arg0, int func, int flags);</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		This greatly reduces the number of entry points that must be implemented to
		handle a given set of APIs. Instead of one entry point per method, you need only
		one entry point per unique signature. Given this "shared stub" an
		implementation of <code>CoInitialize</code> looks like this:
	</p>
	<p class="codeIndent">
		<code>public static void CoInitialize() throws COMException {<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;FuncPtr fp = new FuncPtr("OLE32.DLL", "CoInitialize");<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;fp.invoke(0, ReturnFlags.CHECK_HRESULT);<br>
			}
		</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		Jawin's shared stubs are in the Java class
		<code>org.jawin.marshal.SharedStubs</code>.	The native
		implementation is in the files SharedStubs.cpp and COMMarshal.cpp.
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course, not all functions can be implemented with a finite number of
		shared stubs. For methods with more exotic signatures, Jawin also provides a
		generic stub.
	</p>

	<h2><a name="genericStub">4. Jawin Generic Stub</a></h2>
	<p>
		Jawin's generic stub is a true marshaller, similar to RMI or DCOM.
		The generic stub views a function call as a sequence of events, as
		shown in the <a href="#figure2">figure 2</a> below. Intrinsic
		functions serialize a function into a request message, and the generic
		stub moves this message into native space. There, another set of
		intrinsic functions convert the serialized request into a call stack
		and invoke the function. The entire sequence plays backwards to
		serialize a response message with return values or exceptions and
		ship it back to the caller.
		<a name="figure2"><img class="center" src="img/genericstub.png" height="388px" width="753px"
		alt="Figure 2: Jawin generic stub" title="Figure 2: Jawin generic stub" /></a>
		The generic stub knows how to send messages back and forth from Java to
		Win32, but it does not know the specifics of any particular method. On
		the Java side, the translucent stub knows these details. However, there
		is no Win32-side equivalent of the translucent stub. Sticking to the RMI
		and CORBA naming convention, such a component would be called a
		skeleton. Jawin does not use a skeleton because the request message
		carries the type information with it.
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition to the serialized request, the generic stub also passes an
		<i>instruction stream</i> that describes how to deserialize the request
		on the Win32/COM side. The instruction stream is sequence of bytecodes
		that is processed by a simple interpreter to rebuild the call stack.
		These are not bytecodes in the sense of a Java binary class; they are
		Jawin specific and arbitrary.
	</p>
	<p>
		The figure below shows the instruction stream that is generated when
		marshalling a call to the Win32 API <code>MessageBoxW</code>. The
		instruction stream begins with "0,0,0,0" for the first argument, which
		happens to be an integer valued zero. The second argument is a string,
		which is a little more complex. The "5,0,0,0" is the little endian
		representation of the string length, followed by the string's contents
		encoded as Unicode characters. The remainder of the request (not shown
		in the figure) is generated in similar fashion.
		<a name="figure3"><img class="center" src="img/instructionstream.png" height="235px" width="750px"
		alt="Figure 3: Instruction stream" title="Figure 3: Instruction stream" /></a>
		The code "IGGI" is the instruction stream that tells how to rebuild the
		call stack. The "I" code indicates that a 32 bit value should be copied
		directly into the stack. The "G" code indicates that the stub should
		allocate a Unicode string, read the stream's contents into the string,
		and then place a pointer to the string on the call stack. These
		instruction codes are only a sample, Jawin's instruction string
		vocabulary supports several stack transformation more complex than those
		shown here. The instruction strings drive a state machine that is
		implemented as a switch statement in the <code>Transform::process</code>
		function.
	</p>
	<p>
		Jawin's generic stub is primitive compared to RMI or DCOM. For example,
		it does not understand pointer aliasing. Improvements are being made the
		generic stub on an as-needed basis to support particular use cases.
	</p>
	<p>
		(Jan 2002) I am working to document the instruction streams
		<a href="instruction_docs.html">here</a>.
	</p>

	<h2><a name="errorHandling">5. Error Handling</a></h2>
	<p>
		Jawin automatically converts COM and Win32 errors into instances of <code>org.jawin.COMException</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		For COM errors, the exception will include the <code>HRESULT</code> and
		the	error string. For example, the following fragment attempts to
		create a non-existent COM component:
	</p>
	<p class="codeIndent">
		<code>// from demos/src/demos/BadHresult.java<br>
			try {<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;Ole32.CoInitialize();<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;DispatchPtr p = new DispatchPtr("new:Nonexistent.Component");<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;throw new Error("Attempt to create nonexistent component should fail");<br>
    		} catch (COMException e) {<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;System.out.println("Got Expected Error: " + e);<br>
    		}
    	</code>
    </p>
	<p>
		The preceding example will produce the following <code>COMException</code>:
	</p>
	<p class="codeIndent">
		<code>&gt; ant "demo bad HRESULT"<br>
			&gt; Got Expected Error: org.jawin.COMException: 800401e4: Invalid syntax
		</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		Often, the <code>HRESULT</code> is inadequate to diagnose an error. In
		such situations, it is necessary to also collect any additional
		thread-specific error information set by the object. As an example of this,
		consider the ADO demo included with Jawin (see demos/src/jawin/ado). The
		Ant build target <code>"ado demo"</code> passes in the data source name
		<code>"DSN=Pubs"</code>. If this data source name does not exist, you
		will see an error like this one:
	</p>
	<p class="codeIndent">
		<code>org.jawin.COMException: 80020009:&nbsp;<br>
			[Microsoft][ODBC Driver Manager] Data source name not found and no default<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;driver specified<br>
			[src=Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers,<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guid={0C733A8B-2A1C-11CE-ADE5-00AA0044773D}]
		</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		Without the additional information provided by <code>SetErrorInfo</code>,
		you would see only the <code>HRESULT</code> and the generic information
		<code>Exception Occurred</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		For Win32 errors, the <code>COMException</code> will include the error code
		and text reported by calling <code>GetLastError</code>.
	</p>

	<h2><a name="comThreading">6. COM Threading</a></h2>
	<p>
		The issues in this section <b>only</b> exists for COM, and not for
		Win32/DLL programming.
	</p>
	
	<h3><a name="comThreading_initialize">6.1. Initializing the COM Library on each Thread</a></h3>
	<p>
		First, COM requires that <b>all</b> threads calling a COM object must
		initialize the COM library before making any COM calls.
		This is done by calling:
	</p>
	<p class="codeIndent">
		<code>
			Ole32.CoInitialize();
		</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		If a thread shares or uses COM objects from other threads, the
		COM library should be initialized as multithreaded instead of as the
		default single threaded. This is done by passing the 
		<code>COINIT.MULTITHREADED</code> parameter to the
		<code>CoInitialize</code> method.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a thread is finished with all COM calls, it should call:
	</p>
	<p class="codeIndent">
		<code>
			Ole32.CoUninitialize();
		</code>
	</p>
	<p>
		Microsoft MSDN documents the details of these two methods;
		<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/com/htm/cmf_a2c_5iyg.asp"
		title="MSDN Platform SDK: COM - CoInitializeEx">CoInitializeEx</a> and

	</p>
	
	<h3><a name="comThreading_apartments">6.2. Thread Local and Thread Neutral References (the Apartment <i>Nightmare</i>)</a></h3>
	<p>
		Unlike Java or Win32, COM provides some built-in protection for
		components that can only be called safely from certain threads. The
		architecture to support this is based around apartments. An
		<i>apartment</i> is a group of running components and threads with
		similar threading characteristics. The relationship between a COM
		component and the apartment model is specified at deployment by setting
		well-known values in the registry, but can also be modified at runtime
		by implementing the <code>IMarshal</code> interface. There are a
		confusing variety of possibilities:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A component can live in a single-threaded apartment (STA), which
		means that it should always be called from the same thread.</li>
		<li>A component can live in the multi-threaded apartment (MTA), which
		means that it can be called from any thread in the MTA pool, but can
		never be called from an STA thread.</li>
		<li>Components can also choose the "Both" threading model, which
		means that they will be belong to the apartment of the thread that
		creates them.</li>
		<li>Components can implement the <code>IMarshal</code> interface
		to further customize threading behavior at runtime, adding additional
		nuances to the apartment behavior suggested by their registry settings.
		This feature is commonly used to create components that can visit any
		apartment for the duration of a method call. Such components may be
		called "agile" or be said to "aggregate the free-threaded marshaller."</li>
		<li>In MTS and COM+, the threading model is extended to also include the
		notion of <i>context</i>. A context is a subspace of a process that provides
		some service at runtime, such as security checking or transaction
		enlistment. Components may belong to the same apartment but still be
		incompatible if they belong to different contexts.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		If you are a Java programmer, and you think that the preceding section
		sounds complex, bewildering, and likely to cause trouble, you are right!
		(For the full story on apartments and context, see
		<a href="jawin.html#additionalResources">[Ewa01]</a>.) To
		summarize the apartment story: Apartments are complex, and if you call a
		COM apartment from the wrong thread you may violate apartment rules and
		cause bizarre failures far removed from the problem point in the code.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Jawin architecture provides two levels of service for Java
		programmers:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>For Java programmers who are not experts on COM apartments, the details
		of COM threading are hidden as much as is feasible.</li>
		<li>For Java programmers who are expert on COM apartments, full
		functionality should be available.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The Jawin architecture accomplishes these objectives by mandating the
		following programming model:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>When you create or otherwise gain access to a <code>COMPtr</code>,
		<code>DispatchPtr</code>, or any subclass, you should only use that
		pointer from the thread you are on. When you are done, you <i>must</i>
		call the close method, which will release the underlying <code>IUnknown*</code>.
		This approach is recommended for anyone calling COM objects from a single thread.</li>
		<li>If you wish to use a <code>COMPtr</code>, <code>DispatchPtr</code>, or
		subclass from more than one thread, you should call the
		<code>createGITRef()</code>-method on the <code>COMPtr</code>. This
		call should be made on the original thread, to create a context-neutral
		reference in the Global Interface Table. After you do this, you can
		use the newly created reference from <i>any</i> thread, and Jawin will
		automatically hide the details of creating a local <code>IUnknown*</code>
		as needed. While this approach will always work, it significantly increases
		the overhead (by a factor 5-20) imposed by Jawin on each method call.<br>
		Note that creating such a GIT-reference increases the native reference
		count, so both references must be closed as usual. The original thread-local
		reference must be closed last, and on the original thread. An example of 
		creating such a thread-neutral reference are like:
		<p class="codeIndent">
			<code>
				..<br>
				// create a standard thread local reference<br>
				DispatchPtr directDisp = new DispatchPtr(CLSID);<br>
				// get the thread neutral GIT reference<br>
				DispatchPtr gitDisp = (DispatchPtr)directDisp.createGITRef();<br>
				// and now we are ready to use the gitDisp-reference from several threads.<br>
				..<br>
				..<br>
				// finally after usage from multiple threads the two references<br>
				// must be closed on the original thread.<br>
				gitDisp.close();<br>
				directDisp.close();
			</code>
		</p>
		This approach is recommended for Java programmers who plan to use the
		same COM object from multiple threads, and are not comfortable with the
		details of COM apartments.</li>
		<li>You can improved the performance of option 2 by calling the
		<code>createDirectRef()</code>-method on the thread-neutral reference
		to create a thread-local reference just before making a series of method
		calls. This direct reference must be closed on the thread where it was
		created. This option is recommended for Java programmers who are comfortable
		with the details of COM apartments.</li>
	</ol>
